 This folder contains my submission to the assignments `Lucky Number` - `Grade Student` - `Human Resources` in the course PRO192x_2.1-A_VN (Object-Oriented Programming with Java), a part of the path Software Engineering provided by FUNiX.



## About the project

- The project consists of 3 parts with different coverage of Java basics and OOP (the UI is just displays on console):
  - <a href="PRO192x_Project 1_phupaFX07929@funix.edu.vn">_**Part 1 - Lucky number**_</a> : use Math.random() for random generator, control flow with if-else, variables and expressions in Java, printing out in console, loops in Java.
  -
- **Keyword**: _Java basics, collections, object-oriented programming, OOP_.

## Functional description

- <a href="PRO192x_Project 1_phupaFX07929@funix.edu.vn">_**Part 1 - Lucky number**_</a> :
  - Generate a random number (this is so-called _Lucky Number_) which is between 0 and 100.
  - User inputs his guess and then print out the console **_"số may mắn nhỏ hơn số dự đoán của bạn"_** if the lucky number is **less** than the user's guess; _**"số may mắn lớn hơn số dự đoán của bạn"**_ if the lucky number is greater than the user's guess; "**_chúc mừng bạn đã đoán đúng con số may mắn sau x lần dự đoán"_** if the user gives the right guess (with x is the number of guesses)
  - The guess ends up with the question whether user would like to continue a new turn of guess or not. If yes, continue a new cycle of above steps. Otherwise, report with the total of plays, the total of guess, the average number of guesses per lucky number and the best play.
