 This folder contains my submission to the assignments `Lucky Number` - `Grade Student` - `Human Resources` in the course PRO192x_2.1-A_VN (Object-Oriented Programming with Java), a part of the path Software Engineering provided by FUNiX.



## About the project

- The project consists of 3 parts with different coverage of OOP (the UI is just displays on console):
  - Part 1 - Lucky number: use

- **Keyword**: _logical database design, physical database design, ERD, T-SQL, data model, normalization, 3NF, Microsoft SQL Server_.

## Functional description
<!-- - <a href="Part1_DBI202x_ASM1_phupaFX07929.pdf" target="_blank">Part 1 - _Analyse and design database model_</a> : this part presents the process with following steps:
  - Define **Functional** features of an online newspaper as well as **Non-Functional** ones that affects database design.
  - Create **ERD** with compliant symbols representing **entities, attributes and relationships** and detailed explanations.
  - Translate logical design to **physical design** with tables (with primary keys, foreign keys and constraints).
- <a href="Part2_DBI202x_ASM2_phupaFX07929\DBI202x_ASM2_phupaFX07929.pdf">Part 2 - _Implement database design with Microsoft SQL Server_</a> : based on the results of Part 1, database should be physically implemented with following requirements:
  - Include the source code (T-SQL script) to create database as per the design from Part 1.
  - Create tables with samples of at least 10 records.
  - Create a least a trigger, stored procedure, function, index, transaction with detailed explanations.
  - Execute queries using join, out-join, order by, string comparison and date-time filtering (with explanations). -->
